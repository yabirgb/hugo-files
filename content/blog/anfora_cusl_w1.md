## What is CUSL?

CUSL is the acronym for 'Concurso Universitario de Software Libre' or
Universitary contest of free software. I'm taking part on this contest
with Anfora.

## Week 1 (Feb 01 - Feb 08)

In this first week I've managed to achieve a lot of things.

This week I've experimented with image filters on python and I've
created this [public package](https://github.com/anforaProject/pyfilters.git) to apply some of the filters on
Instragram. There's a minor effects that is not finished but I'm
working on it.
