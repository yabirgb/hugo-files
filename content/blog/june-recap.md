## What did I do / What I'm doing

June has been a month of doing a lot of things and at the same time nothing.

* I finished my semester. Now It's time to enjoy!
* I'm working on zinat (that soon It'll get a new name). I want to
  writte a technical post about what technologies are involved and how
  I wrote the code. At the moment I'm a bit slow but things are working.
* I ordered a Revolout card and I love it <3. Need to share because
  It's a great experience and maybe I'll post more about this on the
  future.
* This month also I managed to deploy a [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/) instance and it's cool.

## Product review

* This month I bought the [1$ pack of
  stickers](https://www.unixstickers.com/) and they are great. The
  quality is very good and the came well protected.
  
## Sad things

* For three months my phone was google free using Lineage OS and microg, but no I'm back with gapps.

## Links

* Eugen (aka Gargron) wrote a good
