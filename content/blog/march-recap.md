In this serie of posts I want to summarize what I have archieved,
what I'm doing and share things I liked from the previous month.

## What I did

* I joined to the Google HashCode 2018 with the `Oh no` team. We ended
  up in a good position with a total score of `36,448,230`. The code
  is available at [github](https://github.com/yabirgb/hashcode2018).

* Started to record my study habits in a spreadsheet so now I count
  all the hours I spend studying and what I study. At the end of the
  semester my idea is to make an study with all this data. By now I
  have 23 days registered and a total of 50h.
  
* Learned to deploy docker's containers, create my own image and how
  to manage containers with `docker-compose` files. All this was by
  creating a lychee server.
  
* Presented a propousal to work with [Read the Docs](http://readthedocs.io/) at the
  Google Summer of Code.
  
* Participated in the google kickstarter but didn't made a greate
  performance.

## What I learned

* ActivityPub is something that has my mind trapped now.

* Started with Clojure following the book online of [Clojure for
  the brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/). At the beggining
  I dind't liked it too much but now I see the potential that it has.
  
  
## Plans

* I want to use one of those portals to share links. But for now I will post a couple here.
