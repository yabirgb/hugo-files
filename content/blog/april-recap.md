## What did I do / What I'm doing

* I'm working on [zinat](//github.com/yabirgb/zinat), a self-hosted gallery
  and social network. The main purpuse of this project is to learn about 
  ActivityPub and practice with new technologies.

* I started (late) the [Tuenti
  Challenge](https://contest.tuenti.net/Contest) but I don't have much
  time.

* I'm learning about webhooks, redis and celery. Those are things that
  I should already know but never is too late.

## What have I learnt?

* I've read about Measurement Theory and the construction of the Lebesgue's integral.
  
## Plans

* I want to use one of those portals to share links. But for now I will post a couple here.
